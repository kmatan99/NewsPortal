# NewsPortal

Greetings!

This repository contains the implementation of a News app that displays articles about happenings from different topics and interests.

The design of this News Portal app revolves around simplicity and straight-forwardness, seeing as over-styling can sometimes lead to distractions from the things you actually want to concentrate on.
Therefore the app is very easy to understand at first glance, all the articles are displayed in a column and clearly visible.

Alongside simplicity, minimalism was the key factor in deciding how to design the app. 
An ordinary user, who comes to view the news, wants to see only that, and nothing else.
Coincidentally, NewsPortal displays only the essentials in a clear manner, meaning there aren't any elements that are remotely redundant

Each article has a category tag which the user can click on to see all other articles from that category, this makes it easy for him to only view the things that pique his interests, as well as being able to view single articles on a full display, and search for articles with keywords the user is interested in.

Instructions to set the app up:

1. git clone https://github.com/kmatan99/NewsPortal
2. Position yourself inside the NewsPortal directory
3. cd client
4. npm install
5. cd..
6. cd server
7. npm install

Steps to run the app (position yourself inside the NewsPortal directory):

1. cd client
2. npm start
3. cd..
4. cd server
5. npm start

Enjoy!
